My unpolished submission for homework #2.

Time Spent:
  ~6 hours, but i should have been able to do this faster, spent too much time just playing with the example code (the planes were very distracting...). I'm submitting what i have for now so i can get some sleep, i'm really enjoying playing around with the perspective just i should have spent more modifying the example code before i started rather than having to reference them so heavily.

Controls:
  1          mode 1 shortcut
  2          mode 2 shortcut
  3          mode 3 shortcut
  m/M        change modes
  t/T        Toggle axes
  arrows     Change view angle
  0          Reset view angle + fov
  ESC/q/Q    Exit
  i/I        Increase FOV
  o/O        Decrease FOV
  =/+        Decrease DIM (zoom in)
  -/_        Increase DIM (zoom out)
  a/A        Increase yaw (look right)
  d/D        Increase yaw (look left)
